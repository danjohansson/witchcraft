(defn tube
  "Draw a tube, pipe, cylinder, or tunnel.

  This can be arbitrarily rotated, it does not have to be axis-aligned.

  `:start` and `:end` are the two ends of the central axis of the cylinder.
  `:radius` is the radius of the cylinder, `:inner-radius` is the space inside
  the \"tube\" that is hollow (or filled in if you specify a `:fill` material).

  Alternatively to specifying `:end` you can specify a `:direction` + `:length`.

  `:material` and `:fill` are either keywords, or functions which receive the
  `[x y z]` position and returns a keyword.

  For best result experiment with fractional numbers, e.g. a `:radius
  6.1 :inner-radius 4.9` may look better than `:radius 6 :inner-radius 5`.

  To compute this we determine the bounding box, then iterate over all blocks,
  project them onto the central axis, and then see if the distance between the
  block and this projected point equals the radius. You can specify the
  `:distance-fn` to use something other than euclidian distance here, e.g.
  Manhatten ([[m/manhatten]]) distance or Chebyshev ([[m/chebyshev]]) distance,
  which will give you more of a square pipe.
