(ns lambdaisland.witchcraft.cursor
  "Logo-like API for drawing blocks by using a walking metaphor.

  This is a functional API, movements simply build up a list of block positions,
  call [[build!]] at the end to actually make them materialize in the game.

  A cursor contains a current location (x/y/z), a
  directions (:north, :north-east, :east, etc.), and a current building
  material, e.g :lapis-block (see [[lambdaisland.witchcraft/materials]]).

  It also contains a drawing flag `:draw?` and a list of blocks `:blocks`. When
  drawing is on, then any step will add a block to the list. [[build!]] creates
  blocks in the world based on this, and resets the list.

  Call [[start]] to get an initial cursor, this will return a cursor that is one
  step ahead of the player (so what you draw is in sight), facing away from the
  player.
